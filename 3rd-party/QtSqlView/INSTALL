You need Qt version 4.1 or higher (tested only with 4.1.4) to compile
QtSqlView. The program highly relies on the QtSql plugins selected with the
Qt-configure program. Query your distribution's documentation on how to install
the required SQL plugins.

After unpacking the source tarball, run

qmake && make

to generate makefiles and compile the binary. The binary can then be run with

./src/QtSqlView

The binary has no support files other than Qt's shared libraries. It can be
copied to whatever place seems fit.
